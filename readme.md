# Go Cookbook

# What is this?

This is a collection of recipes for the Go language. It aims to distill the knowledge of the Go community into simple and clear examples of best practice. 

# Where do the recipes come from?

Some of the recipes have their origins in threads on the Go Nuts mailing list (go-nuts)[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/golang-nuts]. Others are distilled from existing open source code or the Go source code.

# Can I reuse the recipes?

Yes. All content in this Go Cookbook is made available via the [CC0 public domain license](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). See [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)

 
# How can I contribute?

You can edit a recipe or contribute a new one bu submitting a pull request. Please limit each pull request to a single recipe so it's easy to manage and discuss. Feel free to add yourself to the [`CREDITS`](CREDITS) file if you wish. Don't add yourself to the [`AUTHORS`](AUTHORS) file. If your contribution is deemed substantial enough then one of the existing authors will add you.

Do note that in order for any non-trivial changes to be merged (as a rule of thumb, additions larger than about 5 lines), an explicit Public Domain Dedication needs to be on record from you. Please include a copy of the statement found in the [`WAIVER`](WAIVER) file with your pull request.
